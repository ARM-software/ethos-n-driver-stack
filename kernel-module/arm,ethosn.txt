Arm(R) Ethos(TM)-N78 Neural Processing Unit

This binding file describes the device tree layout for the Ethos-N NPU. It describes the properties
required for Carveout and SMMU configuration. For more details please see README.md in the root
of the driver stack.

Required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "ethosn"

    - reg: Memory address range for each Ethos-N core. Each range should be 1MB in size.

    - interrupts: Interrupt list for the error, job, and debug interrupts.
                  This can either be individual interrupt lines or combined into a single line.

        - Multiple lines: Error interrupt uses a positive-polarity, level-sensitive line.
                          Job interrupt uses a positive-polarity, edge-sensitive line.
                          Debug interrupt uses a positive-polarity, edge-sensitive line.

        - Single line:    Each interrupt uses a shared positive-polarity, level-sensitive line.
                          This is the configuration the examples use.

    - interrupt-names: List of interrupt names. Must contain "err", "job", and "debug" in the
                       same order as the interrupts list.

Required sub-nodes. For each Ethos-N core add a sub-node with the following properties:
    - compatible: Must be "ethosn-core"

Required for Carveout:
    - memory-region: phandle for a reserved memory area accessible via DMA:
        - Memory area must begin on a 512MB alligned address
        - Size of the memory area must be a power-of-two between 4MB and 512MB
        - See Memory limitations in README.md for details and
          juno-r2-ethosn.dtsi for an example

Sub-nodes required for SMMU:

    For each Ethos-N core sub-node, add a main allocator sub-node with the following proporties and memory sub-nodes:
        These sub-nodes are used as containers for IOMMU ids used for the firmware code and stack.
        See juno-r2-ethosn-smmu.dts for examples.

        - compatible: Must be "ethosn-main_allocator"

        - firmware: Sub-node that must be named "firmware" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.

        - working_data: Sub-node that must be named "working_data" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.

    Add any number of asset allocator sub-nodes to the main ethosn node with the following proporties and memory sub-nodes:
        These sub-nodes are used as containers for IOMMU ids used for inference data.
        The number of concurrent processes using the Ethos-N NPU is limited to the number of asset allocators.
        See juno-r2-asset-allocs.dtsi for examples.

        - compatible: Must be "ethosn-asset_allocator"

        - command_stream: Sub-node that must be named "command_stream" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.

        - weight_data: Sub-node that must be named "weight_data" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.

        - buffer_data: Sub-node that must be named "buffer_data" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.

        - intermediate_data: Sub-node that must be named "intermediate_data" with the following proporties:
            - compatible: Must be "ethosn-memory"
            - iommus: Single IOMMU id, must be unique among all IOMMU ids used.
